## Maximise Revenue from Top Company

    Pepsi and Dr. Pepper
- Recommendation: if both firms come in partnership or co-branding they will maintain top high revenue by increasing their market share in the market

- Insight: if we study the graph above we can see that certain states like Minnesota, Hawaii, and New York have 
the highest revenue compared to Alaska and Arizona

program with local retailers will further increase high-performing markets in those state

## Focus on Best-Selling Products:
-	Insight: Certain products like Coca-Cola, Green Tea, and Lemonade are the most sold based on units.
-	Recommendation: Increase the promotion and visibility of these best-selling products. Stock them more aggressively in high-demand regions and run marketing campaigns around them to maximize sales.

## Optimize Profit Margins for Low-Performing Companies:
- Insight: Some companies may generate high revenue but have lower profit margins.
- Recommendation: Identify products or companies with lower-than-average profit margins and evaluate their cost structures. Renegotiate terms or improve supply chain efficiency for these companies to enhance profitability

## Diversify Sales in Low-Revenue States:
-	Insight: Some states generate lower revenue.
-	Recommendation: By conduct market research to understand why these states are underperforming. Explore opportunities to improve distribution, marketing, or pricing strategies to increase penetration in these regions.

## Drive Sales through Product Categories:
•	Insight: Certain product categories, such as Soft Drinks and Alcoholic Beverages, generate the most revenue.
•	Recommendation: Develop and promote new flavors, packaging, or variations within these high-performing categories to attract more customers. we can also consider bundling products from these categories for promotions or cross-selling opportunities.

## Adjust Cost of Goods for High-Cost Products:
-	Insight: Products with high cost of goods sold (COGS) may negatively impact profitability.
-	Recommendation: Investigate the supply chain for products with high COGS. Renegotiate contracts with suppliers, find alternative sourcing options, or optimize logistics to reduce costs without compromising on quality.

## Leverage Relationship Between Units Sold and Profit:
- Insight: The scatter plot between units sold and profit might indicate if higher sales volumes correlate with higher profits.
-	Recommendation: If certain products show a positive correlation between units sold and profit, focus on scaling up their distribution. For products where this correlation is weaker, consider discontinuing or repositioning them to improve profitability.

## Balance between Unit Sold And Profit
- Insight: Some products sell in high volume but they don't necessarily generate high profit and vice versa
- Recommendation: To strike a balance between volume-driven and profit-driven products. Ensure that products 
with high sales volume but low-profit margins have an optimized supply chain or adjusted pricing strategies. 
For high-profit but low-volume products, explore ways to increase awareness and visibility. etc

## Conclusion Strategic Advice Summary:
- By understanding which companies, products, and regions perform the best in terms of revenue and profit, we can allocate resources more effectively. Implementing these recommendations will not only drive sales and profitability but also strengthen market positioning. Additionally, consider running A/B tests or pilot programs in underperforming areas or categories to validate the potential of new strategies before full-scale implementation
